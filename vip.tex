\subsection{VIP Escort}\label{vip-escort}

\subsubsection{Problem statement}\label{problem-statement}

In this scenario we have one main UAV we call ``VIP'', multiple
``escort'' UAVs, multiple pre-defined locations of interest. Our aim is
to automatically synthesize a control protocol that guarantees the
following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  The VIP must not move from one location to another without being
  escorted by one of the escorts.
\item
  The VIP cannot visit certain locations until at least one of the
  escorts have inspected the location within the last $x$ steps.
\item
  All the UAVs must go through a certain route to the location of
  interest. This is needed to prevent going through unsafe zones.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Problem Setup}\label{problem-setup}

We model this problem by assigning two output variables $g_{i}$ and
$t_{i}$ and one input variables $s_{i}$ to each escort $UAV_{i}$. The
variables are defined as follows:
